This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the simulations shown in "Heterogeneous expectations, forecasting behaviour 
and policy experiments in a hybrid Agent-based Stock-flow-consistent model", submitted to the Journal of Evolutionary Economics.
That paper is a revised version of "Monetary policy and prudential regulation in a hybrid AB-SFC model with heterogeneous expectations", 
published as ExSIDE working paper No. 08-2018 (http://exside-itn.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/08-2018-WPaper-ExSIDE-all.pdf) the simulation files for which can be found in the repository https://github.com/SReissl/ExSIDE.
As the revised version of the paper contains alternative and expanded simulation experiments and in addition fixes some minor bugs present in the working paper version I recommend using this version of the code. The revised paper is available on request (severin.reissl@eiee.org).
